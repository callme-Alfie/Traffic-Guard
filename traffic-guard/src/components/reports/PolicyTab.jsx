        <h4>ðŸ›‘ Install Speed Bumps in High-Risk Areas</h4>
        <p>Data shows a high frequency of collisions at uncontrolled intersections. Installing speed bumps at <strong>Oak Street & Park Road</strong> and <strong>Downtown Intersection</strong> could significantly reduce speeding-related accidents.</p>
      </div>

      <div className="recommendation-card">
        <h4>ðŸš¦ Increase Traffic Light Timing</h4>
        <p>Heavy congestion and incident buildup reported at <strong>Highway 101 Merge</strong>. Increasing green-light duration during rush hour can reduce vehicle pile-ups and lane-change accidents.</p>
      </div>

      <div className="recommendation-card">
        <h4>ðŸ“£ Community Awareness Campaigns</h4>
        <p>Many accidents are linked to careless pedestrian crossings and distracted driving. Partner with local media to run targeted road safety campaigns across vulnerable zones.</p>
      </div>

      <div className="recommendation-card">
        <h4>ðŸ§¯ Emergency Response Optimization</h4>
        <p>Incident logs show delays in medical assistance. Deploy satellite response units closer to key hotzones and optimize ambulance routing algorithms.</p>
